# simple-3d-engine

Basic 3D renderer written in Java using JWJGL library (OpenGL).

Note: The project was created to show how to display 3d models onto the screen. Projection calculations are performed using solely the CPU. Therefore, projection of high-poly models results in poor framerate.

Current state:
  - WSAD camera movement, QERF camera rotation
  - LShift/Space vertical movement
  - polygon clipping
  - camera light is flashlight alike
  - partially documented
  - need for optimization
